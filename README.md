## Description
Magic Mag - Vehicles is a mod for Arma 3 by Bohemia Interactive. This mod aims to reduce the overall micromanagement needed by AI. In this case, their vehicular ammunition. Players, if they so desire, can also use this mod in their favor.

## Features
- Automatically rearm and reload vehicle classes chosen by the server administrator, or the player (you) in singleplayer;
- Choose if each side's AI gets unlimited ammo for their vehicles;
- Choose if the players get unlimited ammo themselves;
- Adjust some balancing options for dynamic loadout vehicles;
- Great mod compatibility;
  - Additional input box allows you to add any vehicle to the mod;
- Responsive: Any changes to the mod's configuration page will reflect in-game instantly. Add, remove and customize the mod to your liking without restarting the game.

## Installation
1. To install this mod, simply download it from the Steam Workshop.
2. On the Arma 3 Launcher, toggle this mod ON by selecting it and enabling.
3. The mod will be enabled after mission load.

## Usage
1. Start or load a singleplayer or multiplayer mission with the mod enabled.
2. The mod, by default, will automatically give AI units unlimited vehicle ammo.
3. You can customize the mod to your liking by altering its options in the addon configuration menu, accessible by the Escape Menu: Options -> Add-on Settings -> Magic Mag Vehicles.

## Limitations and known issues
- Some weapons were never meant to be reloaded. Unfortunately, this is an issue this mod can not fix, but rather by Bohemia Interactive or the other Mod authors. Attempting to reload a weapon that has reload time "0" will cause an instant reload, which may cause some balancing or difficulty issues.

## Compatibility
- Minimum game version: 2.16

## Dependencies
- CBA_A3: Required for their Extended Event Handlers and mod configuration menu.
